"""/api/synapse/refgraph — the Reference Map: a global citation graph.

Nodes = every repo Paper + every stored Reference + manual RefNodes.
Edges = (:Paper)-[:REFERENCES]->(:Reference)  (a paper cites this work)
        (:Paper)-[:CITES]->(:Paper)           (repo-to-repo citation)
        (a)-[:REF_LINK {label}]->(b)           (manual, between any two nodes)

**Storage keeps one :Reference per paper** — that's what lets each paper hold its
own read-state for the same cited work, and it is not changed here. The merging
below happens only while building this payload: works cited by several papers
collapse into a single node with an edge to each citing paper, so the shared
ground between clusters is visible instead of being duplicated into invisibility.
A reference that resolves to a paper you actually hold gets no leaf at all — the
edge goes straight to the real paper.

The heavy lifting (layout, zoom/pan) is client-side; this route just serves the
payload and handles manual node/edge CRUD. Structured reference add + PDF scan
already live in routes/refs.py and are reused unchanged.
