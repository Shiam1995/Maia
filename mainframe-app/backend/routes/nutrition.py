"""/api/pulse/nutrition — the Nutrition area of Pulse (NUTRITION_SPEC).

Eight areas: dashboard, food log, my foods, recipes, water, weight & body,
fasting, goals. Owned by the Pulse module; every mutation hits the shared
activity log.

Two rules from the spec shape everything here:

  * **The food database starts EMPTY and is never pre-populated.** It grows only
    from foods you actually eat, which is what makes search fast and the data
    trustworthy. (An earlier build seeded ~76 generic foods; the seeder is gone.)
  * **Nutrition is stated PER SERVING**, not per 100g. A serving is whatever you
    actually eat — a slice, a scoop, 150g — so logging is "two of those" rather
    than arithmetic.

A log entry **snapshots** the macros it was created with. Correcting a food's
data later must not silently rewrite what you ate last month — the same reason
Vault snapshots transactions and Synapse snapshots paper titles.

Intolerances and supplements predate this spec and are kept; the spec neither
lists nor forbids them, and there was no reason to delete working features.
